 * Recurring profiles (Subscriptions).
 *
 * Requirements: Cronjob support
 *
 *********************************************************************************/

The main module called "QuickPay" supports recurring payment profiles. Since OpenCart does not have a built in recurring payment trigger mechanism,
it is important to setup a cronjob if the recurring payments should be captured properly. Go the "QuickPay" module settings by clicking the
blue pencil button to the right.
Select the "Recurring payments" tab and copy the URL in the "Remote CRON URL" input field. It is advised that the cronjob is run at least once a day,
but once an hour is recommended.
